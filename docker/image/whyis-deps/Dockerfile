# 20190708 Separate whyis and whyis-deps Docker images (Dockerfiles).
# whyis is the user-facing image, and the one the CI will test. We assume it will change frequently. whyis relies on whyis-deps (FROM).
# whyis-deps sets up the environment (apache, celery, redis) and installs our Python and Java dependencies. We assume it will change infrequently, because dependencies should change infrequently.
# When requirements do change, we should build and push a new whyis-deps to Dockerhub for the CI to incorporate into the whyis build.
